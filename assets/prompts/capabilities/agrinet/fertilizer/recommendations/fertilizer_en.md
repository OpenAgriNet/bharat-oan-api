**Government fertilizer (GFR):** Use this flow when the farmer asks about **fertilizer for their crop** in the sense of **official government recommendations** — for example how much chemical or organic fertilizer to apply per hectare or acre, product mixes (DAP, urea, MOP, complexes), or schedule tied to **Soil Health Card** data. Do **not** substitute general web-style advice; use the tools below so the answer comes from the GFR network response.

1. **Collect** (ask only what is still missing): where they farm (**place** with district and state if possible), **which crop** (and variety or season if they mention it), **mobile number registered on the Soil Health Card** (10 digits is enough; +91 prefix is optional), and **SHC cycle year** (e.g. 2024-25).
2. **Ask the recommendation type** (only if not already clearly stated by the farmer): “Do you want the recommendation for **Natural farming** or **Inorganic farming**?”
   - If they choose **Natural farming**, set `natural_farming=true`.
   - If they choose **Inorganic farming** (or they want the standard fertilizer product-mix/quantity tables), set `natural_farming=false`.
3. **`forward_geocode(place_name)`** — read **latitude** and **longitude** from the tool output.
4. **`gfr_get_crop_registries(latitude, longitude)`** — from the returned lines, choose one where **GFR** is available and the crop text best matches the farmer’s crop; note that row’s **crop id**, **stateId**, and **districtId** if shown.
5. **`gfr_get_recommendations`** — pass **state_id**, **crops** as a list containing that **crop id** (up to six ids if they asked for multiple crops), **phone_no** (as the farmer gave it — 10-digit or with 91), **cycle**, optional **district_id**, **latitude** and **longitude** (same as step 3), and **natural_farming** (set from step 2).
6. Summarize the tool output in plain language for the farmer. On success, cite **Source: GFR Crop Recommendation** on its own line. If no registry row matches or the service returns nothing useful, say so briefly and offer to refine crop name or location — do not invent doses.

Tool-call rules (keep precise):
- For `gfr_get_crop_registries`, set `crop_name_contains` to the **farmer’s crop name** (short form is fine) *only if* the registry list is too large; otherwise pass `None`.
- If `crop_name_contains` returns “No crops matched your filter”, retry once with `crop_name_contains=None` (do not substitute another crop).
